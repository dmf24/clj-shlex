Rewriting the Python `shlex` library in Clojure is a substantial task due to the complexity of the lexical analyzer, which handles shell-like syntax with features like quoting, escaping, comments, and punctuation. Below, I'll provide a Clojure implementation that mirrors the core functionality of the Python `shlex` module, including the `shlex` class, `split`, and `quote functions. The implementation will use Clojure's functional programming paradigm, immutable data structures, and Java interop for I/O operations, while maintaining the same behavior as the Python version.

### Approach
- **Core Structure:** Instead of a Python class, we'll use a Clojure map to represent the lexer state, with functions to manipulate it.
- **State Management:** We'll use immutable data structures and pure functions, passing the lexer state explicitly.
- **I/O Handling:** We'll use Java's `BufferedReader` or `StringReader` for input streams, similar to Python's `StringIO` and `sys.stdin`.
- **Tokenization:** The `read-token` function will implement the state machine logic from Python's `read_token`.
- **Functional Style:** We'll avoid side effects where possible, using recursion and immutable updates instead of mutable state.
- **Iterability:** We'll implement a lazy sequence for token iteration, replacing Python's iterator protocol.
- **Punctuation and POSIX Modes:** We'll support both POSIX and non-POSIX modes, as well as punctuation characters, as in the original.

### Clojure Implementation

(see `src/shlex/core.clj` from initial commit)

### Key Differences and Notes
- **State Management:** The Python version uses a mutable class with instance variables. The Clojure version uses an immutable map, updated via update-lexer. This aligns with Clojure's functional programming principles.
- **I/O Handling:** Python uses StringIO or sys.stdin. Clojure uses StringReader or clojure.java.io/reader for input streams, with char-seq to convert readers to character sequences.
- **Pushback:** Python uses deque for pushback. Clojure uses Java's ArrayDeque via interop, with deque-push and deque-pop helper functions.
- **Iteration:** Python implements `__iter__` and `__next__`. Clojure provides a token-seq function that returns a lazy sequence, which is idiomatic for Clojure.
- **Error Handling:** Python raises ValueError for unclosed quotes or escapes. Clojure throws IllegalArgumentException in similar cases.
- **Character Sets:** Python uses strings for character sets. Clojure uses sets of characters for efficient membership testing.
- **Punctuation Chars:** The handling of punctuation characters is preserved, with dynamic updates to wordchars based on punctuation-chars.
- **Source Hook:** The sourcehook function is simplified but maintains the same logic for file inclusion.
- **Debug Output:** Debug messages are preserved but use Clojure's println instead of Python's print.
- **Split and Quote:** The split and quote functions are direct translations, with split using token-seq to collect tokens and quote using Clojure's regex and string manipulation.

### Limitations
- **Performance:** The Clojure version may be slower due to immutable data structures and functional style, though Clojure's JVM optimizations mitigate this.
- **File Inclusion:** The sourcehook implementation assumes simple file paths. Complex path resolution (e.g., relative to the current file) may need additional logic.
- **Edge Cases:** Some edge cases in POSIX mode or with exotic input may behave slightly differently due to differences in string handling between Python and Clojure.
- **Regex in Quote:** The quote function uses a Clojure regex that approximates Python's _find_unsafe. It may need adjustment for exact equivalence.

### Usage
To use this library, save it as shlex/core.clj and load it in a Clojure project. Example usage:

```clojure
(require '[shlex.core :as shlex])

;; Split a string
(shlex/split "echo 'hello world' > file.txt")
;; => ["echo" "hello world" ">" "file.txt"]

;; Quote a string
(shlex/quote "hello'world")
;; => "'hello'\"'\"'world'"

;; Tokenize from a string
(take 3 (shlex/token-seq (shlex/make-lexer {:instream "ls -l # comment"})))
;; => ["ls" "-l"]
```

### Testing
To test equivalence with Python's shlex, you can compare outputs for common inputs:
```clojure
;; Test split
(= (shlex/split "ls -l 'foo bar'") ["ls" "-l" "foo bar"])
;; Test quote
(= (shlex/quote "foo bar") "'foo bar'")
;; Test token sequence with punctuation
(= (shlex/token-seq (shlex/make-lexer {:instream "ls; echo hi" :punctuation-chars true}))
   ["ls" ";" "echo" "hi"])
```

This implementation should handle most use cases of the Python shlex module, adapted to Clojure's idioms. If you need specific features (e.g., advanced source inclusion, custom error messages), let me know, and I can refine the code further!
