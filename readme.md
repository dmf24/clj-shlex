### clj-shlex

This is an LLM translation of [Eric S. Raymond's Shlex library](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/815061cbab0ff7e3b0062191bae846a83c23c79a/Lib/shlex.py) for Python.

The translation was done by Grok, its commentary can be found in the [grok-commentary.md](grok-commendary.md) file.

I have experimented with Clojure and Babashka a few times over the years and I always missed this library.

The initial commit is the initial result of the LLM interaction.  Subsequent commits will modify and refine it.
